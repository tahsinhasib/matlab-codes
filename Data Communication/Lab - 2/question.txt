Performance Task for Lab Report: (your ID = AB-CDEFG-H)
**Generate a composite signal using three simple signals as,

x1 = a1*cos(2*pi*f1*t), 
x2 = a2*sin(2*pi*f2*t), 
x3 = a3*cos(2*pi*f3*t)

signal_x = x1 + x2 + x3

Select the values of the amplitude and frequency as follows: 
a1 = G + 1, a2 = F + 2, a3 = E + 3, f1 = E + 1, f2 = F + 2, f3 = G + 3.

(a) Show time domain and frequency domain representations of signal_x in a single figure 
window using subplot. Use axis, or xlim, or ylim to appropriately represent the signal.

(b) Quantize signal_x in 4 equally distributed levels and provide image for one cycle of the 
original signal and quantized signal. Use axis, or xlim, or ylim to appropriately represent the 
signal. [Use quantiz() function]

(c) Quantize signal_x in 8 equally distributed levels and provide image for one cycle of the 
original signal and quantized signal. Use axis, or xlim, or ylim to appropriately represent the 
signal. [Do not use quantiz() function]
