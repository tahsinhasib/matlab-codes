Assume your ID is AB-CDEFG-H, and then convert ‘E’, ‘F’ and ‘G’ to 4-bit 
binary to have a bit stream of 12 bits. Convert this bit stream to digital signal using 
the following methods:

1. Polar NRZ-L assuming bit rate is 4 kbps.
2. Manchester assuming bit rate is 2 kbps.
3. AMI assuming bit rate is 5 kbps.
4. MLT-3 assuming bit rate is 10 kbps
