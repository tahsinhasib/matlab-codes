Performance Task for Lab Report: (your ID = AB-CDEFG-H)
Convert the following analog signal into digital data:

sig = a1*sin(2*pi*f1*t) + a2*cos(2*pi*f2*t) + a3*sin(2*pi*f3*t) + a4*sin(2*pi*f4*t);

[a1 = F + 1, a2 = F + 3, a3 = F + 2, a4 = F + 4, f1 = G + 5, f2 = G + 7, f3 = G + 1, f4 = G + 2]

(a) Show analog signal, sampled signal, and quantized signal.

(b) Show the digital data from the analog signal.

(c) What are the appropriate values of sampling frequency and number of levels of quantization if 
minimum required SNR and bandwidth of the channel are 25 dB and 150 Hz respectively
