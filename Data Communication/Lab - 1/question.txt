Performance Task for Lab Report: (your ID = AB-CDEFG-H)
**Generate two sinusoids with different amplitudes, frequencies, and phases.

x1(t) = K1*cos(2π(E+F+5)t + J1)
x2(t) = K2*cos(2π(C+D+5)t + J2)

The value of the amplitudes are as follows: let K1 = A+B and K2 = G+H+2. For the phases, use 
J1 = D+G+20 (in degrees), and take J2 = 30º. When doing computations in Matlab, make 
sure to convert degrees to radians.

(a) Make a plot of both signals on two separate figure windows, over a range of ‘t’ that will 
exhibit approximately 3 cycles. Make sure that you have enough samples per period of the wave
to have a smooth signal in figure.

(b) Create a third sinusoid as the sum: x3(t) = x1(t) + x2(t). In Matlab this amounts to summing 
the vectors that hold the samples of each sinusoid. Make a plot of x3(t) over the same range of 
time as used in the previous two plots.

(c) Use subplot (3,1,1), subplot (3,1,2), and subplot (3,1,3) to make a three-panel subplot that 
puts all of three signals (x1(t), x2(t), and x3(t)) on the same window. See help subplot.
