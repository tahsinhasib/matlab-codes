Performance Task for Lab Report: (your ID = AB-CDEFG-H)
**Generate a composite signal using two simple signals as,

x = A1 sin(2π((C+D+H)*100)t ) + A2 cos(2π((D+E+H)*100)t) + s*randn(size(t));

(a) Select the value of the amplitudes as follows: 
let A1 = (A+B+H), A2 = (B+C+H) and s = (C+D+H)/30

(b) Calculate the SNR value of the composite signal.

(c) Find the bandwidth of the signal and calculate the maximum capacity of the channel.

(d) What will be the signal level to achieve the data rate
